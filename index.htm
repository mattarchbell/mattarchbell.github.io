About Me </h2>

<h3>
Current Studies</h3>

<p>
I am currently attending Fleming College for full time studies in the Geographic Information Systems - 
Applications Specialist postgraduate program in Lindsay. I Previously completed a Bachelors of Science Degree in the 
Wildlife Biology and Conservation program at the University of Guelph. 
My interests lie in using GIS and remote sensing in the realm of conservation to help shape future policy development.
</p>

<h3>
Areas of Interest</h3>

<p>
When I'm not spending time on my studies, I enjoy spending time outdoors. I am an avid birder and often contribute wildlife sitings 
using the I-Naturalist app and E-Bird. I am also an active participant in the Citizen Science program Adopt a Pond, 
run by the Toronto zoo, and contribute data to both the Ontario Turtle Tally and Frogwatch conservation efforts. I like to use these opportunities 
as an excuse to get out for a hike or a paddle!
</p>

<h3>
Recent Volunteer Positions</h3>

<p>
This past spring I had the opportunity to volunteer for nightjar surveys to help determine nightjar range in 
southern Ontario with <a href="https://www.thelandbetween.ca/" alt="The Land Between"> The Land Between<a>. I also volunteered with Blazing Star 
Environmental in partnership with the Canadian Wildlife Service and Trent University to monitor the Western Chorus Frog,
a threatened species in Ontario (click
