<h1>
How I managed GNSS Error
</h1>

<h2>
Atmospheric Error
</h2>

<p>
I chose to conduct my GNSS collection measurements on a clear day with a cool temperature of 9 degrees Celsius. Canada has a low TEC so that hopefully didn't affect my readings too much.
</p>

<h2>
Satellite Geometry Error
</h2>

<p>
I made my observations at around 3:45 PM, where Number of Satellites peaked for the day (fig 1.)

<p>
This time also - likely due to the number of satellites - had some of the lowest DOPs (fig 2.)

<p>
PDOP recorded on my phone was approximately 2.325 m on average over 4 readings. It was unable to be calculated for the readings I took that were averaged, but these averaged readings appear even more accurate
</p>

<h2>
Multi-path Error
</h2>

<p>
This error was tough to avoid. The survey point was behind a cedar tree next to a tall church tower… However I was outdoors, not inside, this probably helped a little.

<h2>
Intended Error
</h2>

<p>
Cannot avoid this inaccuracy on my phone. I am hoping that this issue doesn’t really exist too much anymore. However, my phone has a small antennae, so it likely doesn’t have the greatest receiver accuracy of all time…
</p>


<h2>
Reciever Timing Error
</h2>

<p>
This is not really something I can avoid. This along with atmospheric errors were likely the largest cause of GNSS location error during my observations.
</p>


<h1>
Accuracy Estimate
</h1>

<p>
I think my best results occurred when I averaged 25 points, however I had some very inaccurate results over the course of my testing. 2 back to back tests with 25 points very nearly the same result, while 2 back to back tests 2 minutes later yielded nearly the same result, but almost 6 meters away! 
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, my survey point was a vertical benchmark and the Location accuracy was way off - it was extrapolated quite a long time afterward from the position on the map. I included an estimated "True point" to show how inaccurate my results were. I don't think I had any better than 10m accuracy, even while averaging points.
